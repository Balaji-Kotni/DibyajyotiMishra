<h2> Hey, How you doin'? Hope you are doing great. </h2>

  âœŒ

I am a full stack developer specialized at MERN tech stack and Fluuter. I also do some part-time designing- UI/UX designing.. 

I also spend a lot of time teaching myself Flutter and try to experiment by building UIs. A self-taught programmer, I love helping others in clearing off their bugs.
**P.S.: I do ask people whenever I fail to debug some codes**.

I have been freelancing for over a year now, starting off in early 2019s and has a handful of projects to showcase in portfolio whose work is still on progress.
